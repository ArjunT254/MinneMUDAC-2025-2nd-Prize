# MUNDAC Hackathon - Push To Prod 🚀

🏆 **2nd Place Winner - MinneAnalytics MUNDAC Hackathon 2025**  
📅 Duration: One-month long challenge  
🤝 In collaboration with: Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities  
🎯 Theme: **Using data science to improve youth mentorship outcomes**

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Mentorship relationships can significantly boost youth educational and life outcomes. However, many mentor-mentee matches end early due to hard-to-measure emotional and behavioral factors. Our challenge was to:

- Analyze structured and unstructured data from Big Brothers Big Sisters
- Identify early indicators of match closure
- Recommend data-driven strategies to improve long-term mentorship outcomes

## 💡 Our 3-Phase Solution

### 🔹 Pre-Match
- Clustered mentor and mentee profiles into high-potential “buckets”
- Proposed matching strategies to optimize for long-term compatibility

### 🔹 During Match
- Applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to support contact notes
- Detected emotional signals and predicted closure reasons and timing
- Designed a decision-tree style tool to assist staff in identifying at-risk matches early

### 🔹 Post-Match
- Suggested targeted, research-backed interventions to strengthen ongoing relationships
- Highlighted areas where additional support could extend match duration
